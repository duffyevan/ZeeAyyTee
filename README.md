# ZeeAyyTee
A Z80 Computer Running Inside of an Arduino

##There Are 3 Files##
- **ZeeAyyTee.ino**: *This is the emulator itself, written in Arduino C*
- **EmulationGeneration.py**: *This is a python script that makes my life slightly easier when formatting the monsterous switch/case to emulate instructions*
- **Code.c**: *This is just the output of the python script*

##This will be done "Eventually"##
I work a lot, but I will get it done soon
